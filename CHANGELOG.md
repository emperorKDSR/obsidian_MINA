# Changelog

All notable changes to MINA V2 will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Checklist — Refresh button** — ↻ icon in CHECKLIST header re-indexes `thoughtChecklistIndex` from vault and re-renders the view on demand
- **IndexService — `thoughtDoneChecklistIndex`** — new index populated with `- [x]` lines from MINA V2 files modified today; cleared on each `buildThoughtIndex` rebuild

### Changed
- **Checklist — section order** — CHECKLIST now renders above the Overdue task group in the Command Center TO DO area
- **Checklist — tick behaviour** — ticking an item instantly moves it to the bottom of the list via local re-render (no full view re-render); item is sourced from vault truth (`thoughtDoneChecklistIndex`) after re-index, with `checklistCompletedToday` as the optimistic 400 ms window
- **Checklist — drag reorder** — all items (open and done) are now draggable; `checklistOrder` tracks the full combined list; deduplication prevents double entries after vault re-index
- **Checklist — done items source** — done items shown in CHECKLIST are now read directly from the vault (`- [x]` in today's files) rather than session state alone
- **CommandCenterTab — inline triggers** — `@word ` resolves to `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]` via NLP date parsing; `+` at line start inserts `- [ ] `; `[[` opens file suggester
- **IndexService — YAML field fixes** — `context:` (singular) read correctly; `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]` wikilink strings stripped before date comparison
- **Commands** — removed all plugin commands except "MINA: Open Command Center"
