# Changelog

All notable changes to MINA V2 will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.9] - 2026-04-20
### Feat — Synthesis Tab Redesign

Complete rewrite of the Synthesis tab replacing 100% inline styles with a proper CSS architecture.

**Changes:**
- **CSS-first**: All inline styles replaced with `.mina-synthesis-*` CSS classes (~200 lines).
- **Search/Filter**: New filter input in sidebar header for instant thought searching.
- **Count Badge**: Unprocessed thought count displayed as accent badge next to title.
- **Improved Cards**: Timestamp ("2 hours ago"), title, body preview, and "✓ Process" button per card.
- **Mark Processed**: Quick-process button to mark thoughts without synthesizing into a note.
- **Drag Feedback**: Cards show `.is-dragging` state with scale transform.
- **Proper Mobile Detection**: Uses `isTablet()` utility instead of `clientWidth < 600`.
- **Responsive**: Phone gets full-width sidebar; tablet/desktop get split-pane (340px → 380px).
- **HelpModal**: Updated Synthesis section with Inbox Feed, Drag & Drop, Quick Process documentation.

## [1.5.8] - 2026-04-20
### Feat — Monthly Review Navigation

Monthly Review is now accessible directly from the Command Center navigation grid.

**Changes:**
- **Nav grid**: Added "Monthly" item to SYSTEM cluster (icon: `calendar-range`). Renamed "Review" → "Weekly" for clarity.
- **MonthlyReviewTab**: Replaced 100% inline styles with proper CSS classes (`mina-monthly-*`). Uses `renderPageHeader()` and `renderEmptyState()` from BaseTab.
- **CSS**: Added dedicated Monthly Review stylesheet block (~120 lines) with responsive breakpoint for small screens.
- **HelpModal**: Expanded Monthly Review section with Navigation, Stats, Habit Adherence, Project Progress, and Focus entries.

## [1.5.7] - 2026-04-20
### Feat — Tablet UX Enhancements

Comprehensive tablet audit and upgrade. Tablets (iPad, Android tablets with short-edge ≥ 768px) now receive a **desktop-class experience** instead of being treated as oversized phones.

**Changes:**
- **Command Center header**: Desktop-sized buttons (42px) on tablet instead of phone-oversized (48px).
- **Habit Quick Bar**: Horizontal scrollable bar on tablet (desktop layout) instead of grid (phone layout). Tooltips enabled.
- **Habit name length**: 13 chars on tablet (desktop) instead of 11 (phone).
- **Goal cards**: Monthly goals expanded by default on tablet. Goal edit buttons use desktop density.
- **Navigation clusters**: All clusters expanded on tablet — no collapsible phone accordion.
- **Tactical rows**: Desktop-density padding and min-height on tablet.
- **Help Modal**: Desktop sidebar+content layout on tablet instead of phone accordion.
- **CSS refinements**: Tablet-specific `@media (min-width: 768px)` block restores hover effects, desktop card padding, title sizing, and hides the mobile FAB.
- **Capture FAB**: Hidden on tablet (inline capture bar is active instead).

**Files modified:** `src/tabs/CommandCenterTab.ts`, `src/modals/HelpModal.ts`, `styles.css`, `src/modals/HelpModal.ts` (manual entry).

**Architecture:** All tablet detection uses `isTablet()` from `src/utils.ts` (short-edge ≥ 768px). Pattern: `Platform.isMobile && !isTablet()` = phone-only. `!Platform.isMobile || isTablet()` = desktop-or-tablet.

## [1.5.6] - 2026-04-20
### Feat — In-Plugin Manual (Help Modal)

MINA now ships with a built-in **interactive manual** accessible from the `?` button in the Command Center header.

**Design:**
- Desktop: wide modal (~820px) with a **left sidebar** (all 17 modules listed with icons) and a scrollable **content pane**. Clicking a section loads its items instantly.
- Mobile: full-screen modal with a **collapsible accordion** — each module expands in place, one at a time.
- **Global search bar** on both layouts filters across all sections by label, description, or tip text.

**Content (17 sections):**
Command Center, Quick Capture, Tasks, Thoughts & Timeline, Habits, Projects, Finance (Dues), Weekly Review, Monthly Review, Compass, Synthesis, AI Chat, Voice Notes, Journal, Daily Workspace, Timeline, Settings.

Each item has a plain-language description and where relevant a 💡 tip with practical advice.

**Architecture:**
- `src/modals/HelpModal.ts` (new): `Modal` subclass with `_renderDesktop()` / `_renderMobile()` / `_renderSectionContent()` / `_renderSearchResults()`. All content is static data (`SECTIONS` array) — zero vault reads.
- `CommandCenterTab.renderHeader()`: Added `?` (circle-help) button next to Zen toggle. Opens `HelpModal`.
- CSS: `mina-help-modal`, `mina-help-sidebar`, `mina-help-content`, `mina-help-item-card`, `mina-help-accordion-*`, `mina-help-search-*`

## [1.5.5] - 2026-04-20
### Fix — Mobile Tab Navigation (no new window on tab switch)

On mobile, switching between tabs no longer spawns a new Obsidian tab/window. Previously, `activateView()` always called `workspace.getLeaf('tab')` when the exact target tab wasn't already visible, causing a fresh tab to be opened on every navigation action.

**Root cause:** `getLeaf('tab')` unconditionally creates a new leaf regardless of existing open MINA views.

**Fix (`src/main.ts — activateView()`):**
1. After the existing exact-match and dedicated-leaf lookups, a new mobile-only check scans `leaves` for any existing MINA leaf and reuses it (`leaves[0]`).
2. If no MINA view exists at all, falls back to `workspace.getLeaf(false)` (reuse current pane) instead of `getLeaf('tab')`.
3. Desktop behaviour is unchanged — still opens a dedicated `'window'` leaf.

## [1.5.4] - 2025-07-29
### Feat — Data-Driven Weekly Review (F3)

The Weekly Review tab gains a **"Week at a Glance"** panel — a real-time dashboard summarising the current ISO week from live IndexService data. Zero vault reads; all computation is synchronous from in-memory indices.

**Architecture:**
- `ReviewTab.renderGlancePanel()`: Inserts collapsible glance panel between the review header and the body sections. Collapse state is persisted in the instance. Refresh button re-renders all four cards on demand.
- `ReviewTab.computeGlanceData(weekId)`: Synchronously derives `GlanceData` from `taskIndex`, `dueIndex`, `projectIndex`, and habits settings. Tasks: completed = status=done + modified in ISO week; overdue = status=open + due before today. Habits: scans 7 daily `.md` files via `metadataCache` (no vault reads). Projects: active this week = `file.stat.mtime` within ISO week, not archived. Finance: paid = `lastPayment` within ISO week; overdue = `dueMoment` before today (paid takes priority).
- Four sub-renderers: `renderGlanceTasks`, `renderGlanceHabits`, `renderGlanceProjects`, `renderGlanceFinance` — each renders a `mina-glance-card` with header, stats/rows.
- Desktop: 2-column CSS Grid. Mobile (≤480px): single-column stack. Max-height 220px with overflow scroll.
- CSS: `mina-review-glance`, `mina-glance-card`, `mina-glance-stat-*`, `mina-glance-habit-*`, `mina-glance-project-*`, `mina-glance-finance-*`

## [1.5.3] - 2025-07-29
### Feat — Edit Project + Manual Project Picker (F2)

Projects are now fully editable from the Projects tab. Capture modal gains a manual project picker on both mobile (project pill in chip strip) and desktop (folder button in chip area).

**Architecture:**
- `EditProjectModal` (new): Bottom sheet on mobile, centered modal on desktop. Pre-fills all fields (name, goal, status, due, color). Calls `VaultService.updateProject()` on save. Swipe-to-dismiss on mobile.
- `ProjectPickerModal` (new): `SuggestModal<ProjectEntry | null>` with search filter, colored dot indicators, status badges, and "clear" null option. Used by both mobile pill and desktop picker.
- `ProjectsTab.renderCard()`: Added `.mina-project-card__header-actions` cluster with pencil `EditProjectModal` trigger. Hover-reveal on desktop, always-visible on mobile.
- `EditEntryModal`: Mobile chip strip gains `mina-project-pill` (empty/active states, colored dot, dismiss ×). Desktop chip area gains `mina-proj-zone` with folder button or active chip.
- CSS: `mina-edit-project-sheet`, `mina-epm-*`, `mina-project-card__edit-btn`, `mina-project-pill`, `mina-proj-zone`


### Feat — Task Metadata Write Path (F1)

Priority, energy, and status fields are now fully writable from both the New Task and Edit Task flows. The `EditEntryModal` gains a metadata strip that renders on desktop (always-visible zone in the canvas) and mobile (horizontally-scrollable bottom dock bar).

**Architecture:**
- `EditEntryModal`: 3 new public fields `currentPriority`, `currentEnergy`, `currentStatus`; `_buildMetaStrip()` renders toggle buttons per breakpoint; `onSave` callback extended with trailing `priority?`, `energy?`, `status?` params
- `VaultService.buildTaskFrontmatter()`: added `priority?` and `energy?` params → writes `priority:` / `energy:` YAML lines
- `VaultService.createTaskFile()`: `opts` extended with `status?` — allows non-`open` initial status
- `VaultService.editTask()`: `opts?` param added → writes `priority`, `energy`, `status` via `processFrontMatter`
- `TasksTab`: New Task + Edit Task callbacks pass all 3 metadata fields; Edit pre-populates modal state
- CSS: `mina-meta-zone` (desktop, hidden on mobile), `mina-task-meta-bar` (mobile, hidden on desktop), `mina-meta-btn` toggle buttons with active state

## [1.5.1] - 2025-07-28
### Feat — Recurring Tasks (rm-7)

Recurring task support with auto-spawn on completion, `↻ Recurring` filter segment, and full recurrence editing in `EditEntryModal`.

**Architecture:**
- New `RecurrenceRule` type: `'daily' | 'weekly' | 'biweekly' | 'monthly'`
- `TaskEntry.recurrence?: RecurrenceRule` + `TaskEntry.recurrenceParentId?: string`
- `computeNextDue(currentDue, rule)` utility in `utils.ts`
- `IndexService` parses `fm.recurrence` + `fm.recurrenceParentId` from task frontmatter
- `VaultService.createTaskFile()` extended with optional `opts.recurrence` + `opts.recurrenceParentId`
- `EditEntryModal._buildRecurStrip()` — recur zone in mobile (inside date zone) and desktop (sibling canvas zone)

**UX:**
- `↻ Recurring` segment (amber) in TasksTab filter bar — groups tasks by frequency (daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly)
- On task completion: auto-spawns next occurrence with `computeNextDue`, displays `Notice` confirmation
- `mina-chip--recur` badge on recurring task rows across all views
- Recur strip: 4 frequency buttons (44px mobile, 28px desktop) with amber active state
- Done task preserved as audit log; next task inherits all context/project fields

## [1.5.0]- 2025-07-28
### Feat — Project Lifecycle Entities (rm-6)

New vault-entity-backed `ProjectsTab` replacing the tag-based grid, providing a full project management dashboard with card list, inline expansion, status management, and color coding.

**Architecture:**
- New `ProjectEntry` type with `id`, `name`, `status`, `goal`, `due`, `created`, `color`, `filePath` fields
- `IndexService.buildProjectIndex()` scans `Settings.projectsFolder` (default: `Projects/`) at startup
- `VaultService`: `createProject()`, `updateProject()`, `archiveProject()`, `loadProjectNotes()` methods
- `NewProjectModal` — clean-slate form with Name, Goal, Status seg-bar (Active/On Hold), Due date, 8-color swatch picker
- `ProjectsTab` — full vault-entity card list with filter pills (All/Active/On Hold/Completed), color-coded left-border cards, inline expand panel with task preview, status popover picker
- `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.projectsFolder: 'Projects'` + `MinaSettings.projectsFolder: string`

**UX:**
- Filter pills: All / Active / On Hold / Completed
- Card sort: active → on-hold → completed, alphabetical within groups
- Status badge: click to open inline popover with status options
- Expand panel: top-5 open tasks, View (opens vault file) + Archive actions
- NEXT task preview: earliest-due open task surfaced on card
- Task linkage: matches by `task.project === project.id || task.project === project.name` (backward compat)
- Desktop: 2-column grid layout via `@media (min-width: 768px)`

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-21
### Feat — Habits Tab & Streak Engine (rm-2)

New dedicated `HabitsTab` providing a full habit tracking dashboard with streak analytics.

**Architecture:**
- Scans vault habit history files (past 90 days) on tab open to compute per-habit streaks
- `computeStreaks(habitId)` calculates: current streak, best streak (90-day window), this-week count, this-month count
- Habit toggles reuse existing `plugin.toggleHabit()` and suppress vault-event re-renders via `_habitTogglePending`
- Tab registered as `'habits'` in `view.ts` and accessible from Command Center navigation

**Today Quick-Bar:**
- Full-width 2-column grid (3-col tablet, 4-col desktop) for all active habits
- Full habit names visible; reuses `mina-habit-quick-btn` ring animation and `is-done` / `just-done` states
- Live progress bar and count label update on toggle; all-complete celebration class

**Streak Leaderboard:**
- Compact `<table>` ranked by current streak (highest first)
- Columns: Icon | Habit | 🔥 Current | Best | Month%
- Threshold color coding: 0=faint, 1–6=muted, 7–13=accent, 14–29=amber, 30+=red/bold

**Monthly Heat-Map:**
- 7-column ISO week grid with `< >` month navigation
- Day cell states: `is-done` (accent), `is-partial` (semi-transparent, for "all habits" mode), `is-missed` (red-tint), `is-today` (outline), `is-future` (dimmed)
- Habit filter pills to view any single habit or aggregate all
- Day-of-week (M T W T F S S) header row

**Management Row:**
- ⚙ Manage Habits → opens `HabitConfigModal`
- ↺ Reset Today → `ConfirmModal` guard, clears `completed[]` in today's frontmatter

**Navigation:**
- `Habits` entry added to ACTION cluster in Command Center footer (replaces Timeline which moved to MANAGEMENT)


### Feat — Structured Weekly Review (rm-1)

Complete rewrite of `ReviewTab.ts` with vault-persisted structured reflection.

**Architecture:**
- Weekly review files written to `Reviews/Weekly/YYYY-Www.md` (ISO week format)
- Full vault persistence via `VaultService.saveWeeklyReview()` and `loadWeeklyReview()`
- On tab open, existing review data is loaded and textareas pre-populated
- Ctrl+Enter / ⌘+Enter keyboard shortcut to save from anywhere in the form

**UI:**
- 4 collapsible section cards: 🏆 Wins, 📚 Lessons, 🎯 Next Week's Focus (3 numbered slots), 💡 Habit Highlight (read-only, auto-computed)
- Two-column layout on desktop via CSS container query (`@container mina-review (min-width: 340px)`)
- Dirty indicator dot appears in header when unsaved changes exist
- Save button: Default → Saving… → ✓ Saved (green spring animation) / ⚠ Save Failed
- Section collapse state persisted in `sessionStorage` — survives tab switches
- Previous Week card at bottom: collapsed by default, expands to render previous week's `.md` with `MarkdownRenderer`, "Open in Vault →" button
- Auto-expanding textareas (same pattern as capture bar)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-20
### Fix — Data Integrity, Security & Stability

**rm-3: Monthly Review Denominator Fix**
- Completion rate now uses tasks created/due *this month* as denominator — no longer inflated by entire vault history
- Thoughts stat card now shows "X captured / Y processed" for a real throughput metric

**rm-4: processFrontMatter Migration (Data Integrity)**
- `editThought`, `editTask`, `toggleTask`, `setTaskDue`, `updateTaskTitle` all migrated to `app.fileManager.processFrontMatter`
- Eliminates all string-based YAML regex manipulation — multiline values, special characters and quoted strings can no longer corrupt frontmatter
- Preserves `created`, `pinned`, `project`, `status`, `energy` fields automatically on every edit

**rm-5: DueEntry Amount from Frontmatter**
- Financial obligation amounts now read from `amount` frontmatter field (not parsed from filename)
- Renaming a due file no longer corrupts its amount
- Graceful legacy fallback: files without frontmatter `amount` still parse from filename

**rm-8: VoiceTab MediaStream / RAF / AudioContext Leak Fix**
- Added `activeStream` field — stream tracks always stopped in error path and on tab switch
- `processRecording` wrapped in try/catch — failed transcription no longer orphans state on `'processing'`
- `cleanup()` now nulls `mediaRecorder` after stop, preventing double-stop errors on iOS
- Prevents battery drain and microphone lockout on mobile

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-20
### Feat — 5-State Voice Capture Redesign

Complete rewrite of the Voice tab as a best-in-class, cross-platform voice capture system.

**State Machine Architecture:**
- Replaced the single-screen UI with a 5-state DOM machine: `idle → recording → processing → reviewing → confirmed`
- `data-voice-state` attribute drives CSS visibility — zero JS DOM thrashing on transitions

**New Features:**
- **Auto-transcription**: Recording automatically transcribes after stopping — no manual Transcribe step needed
- **Inline Review state**: Editable transcript card with source badge (tap to play audio) — no modal interruption
- **Dual CTA routing**: Save as Thought (💭) or Create Task (✓) directly from review state
- **Sidecar `.md` files**: Each recording now saves a metadata file alongside the audio (duration, transcript, created)
- **Live waveform**: Real-time AudioContext FFT canvas during recording; 7-bar CSS animation fallback
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (desktop): `Space` = record/stop, `T` = save thought, `K` = create task, `Esc` = discard — suppressed when textarea focused
- **Long-press mic** (500ms): Start recording immediately without releasing touch
- **Swipe-left transcript**: Discard with rubber-band visual feedback (>80px, <400ms)
- **Swipe-up CTA strip**: Opens full EditEntryModal for power users who need context/due-date tagging
- **Haptic feedback** (`navigator.vibrate`) on all state transitions — graceful no-op on iOS

**Mobile UX Fixes:**
- Transcribe button: **28px → 44px** (was below minimum touch target)
- Mic button: 88×88px (up from 120×120px monolithic style — now proper 88px with accessibility sizing)
- CTA strip: sticky bottom with `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` — safe for iPhone notch/home indicator
- Timer: monospace 36px, live REC dot with blink animation
- Tablet guard: `isTablet()` → skips inline CTA, routes to EditEntryModal

**CSS additions (~250 lines):**
- `.mina-voice-shell`, `.mina-voice-stage`, `.mina-voice-header`
- `.mina-mic-btn` + `.is-recording` + `@keyframes mina-mic-pulse-ring`
- `.mina-wave-bars`, `.mina-wave-bar` + `@keyframes mina-bar-pulse` (+ `.is-idle` paused state)
- `.mina-waveform-canvas`, `.mina-waveform-wrap.is-live`
- `.mina-voice-timer-row`, `.mina-rec-dot`, `.mina-rec-label`, `.mina-voice-timer`
- `.mina-voice-spinner` + `@keyframes mina-spin`
- `.mina-vs-reviewing`, `.mina-transcript-card`, `.mina-transcript-textarea` (16px iOS zoom fix)
- `.mina-source-badge`, `.mina-edit-hint`
- `.mina-voice-cta`, `.mina-cta-thought`, `.mina-cta-task`, `.mina-cta-discard`
- `.mina-voice-toast` + spring entrance animation
- `.mina-clip-row`, `.mina-clip-transcribe-btn` (44px height fix)
- Breakpoint overrides: XS ≤340px, LG 481–767px, desktop ≥768px
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` block

**Clips panel:**
- 8 clips shown (was 10) — cleaner in sidebar
- Transcribing from clips now routes to the Review state (not EditEntryModal directly)

## [1.2.8] - 2026-04-20
### Chore — Remove 5 orphaned tabs

Deleted 5 tab files that had no entry point in the Command Center and were unreachable through normal navigation:

| Removed Tab | Route Key | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `ThoughtsTab.ts` | `review-thoughts` | Orphaned — no hub button; functionality superseded by Daily Workspace |
| `MementoMoriTab.ts` | `memento-mori` | Orphaned — no hub button |
| `FocusTab.ts` | `focus` | Orphaned — no hub button |
| `HabitsTab.ts` | `habits` | Orphaned — no hub button; not registered in title switch |
| `ContextTab.ts` | `grundfos` / custom modes catch-all | Orphaned — Grundfos-era legacy, superseded |

**`view.ts` cleanup:**
- Removed `getModeTitle()` cases for `review-thoughts`, `focus`, `memento-mori`
- Removed `renderTab()` route branches for all 5 deleted tabs (including `grundfos`/`customModes` catch-all)
- Removed orphaned view state properties: `thoughtsFilterTodo`, `thoughtsFilterDate`, `thoughtsFilterDateStart`, `thoughtsFilterDateEnd`, `thoughtsFilterContext`, `showPreviousThoughts`, `showCaptureInThoughts`, `thoughtsOffset`

**`main.ts` cleanup:**
- Default tab on open changed from `'review-thoughts'` → `'home'` (Command Center)

## [1.2.7] - 2026-04-20
### Feature — Mobile long-press edit/delete for thought cards

#### Added
- **Long-press to edit or delete thoughts on mobile** — Thought cards in the Daily Workspace now support a long-press interaction (500ms stationary hold) on mobile phones. Activating a card reveals an inline **EDIT / DELETE** action strip that slides in at the bottom of the card (height 0 → 48px animated). Tapping outside any activated card collapses the strip.
- **Long-press engine** (`attachLongPress()`) — Scroll-safe: a `pointermove` guard cancels the hold if the finger travels >8px, so normal scrolling never accidentally triggers the strip. Haptic hint via `navigator.vibrate(25)` on activation. `contextmenu` suppression prevents Android/iOS system menus from appearing on hold.
- **Touch targets at 48px** — Both EDIT and DELETE buttons are 48×(50% card width), well above the 44px AAA minimum. Each has distinct color coding: EDIT in `--interactive-accent`, DELETE in `--text-error`.
- **Dismiss listener cleanup** — The one-shot document-level dismiss listener is stored on the element and removed on re-render, preventing listener leaks across renders.
- **Reduced motion support** — `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables the strip slide animation and press scale.

#### Changed
- Desktop hover-reveal actions: no change (pencil + trash, `opacity: 0 → 1` on hover, 28×28px).
- Tablet (`isTablet()`) routes to the desktop path — hover-reveal, not long-press.

#### Fixed
- Removed dead CSS rule `.is-mobile .mina-dw-entry-actions { opacity: 1; }` that was never wired and has been superseded by the long-press strip.


### Patch & Enhancement — Image rendering, paste stability, Enter behavior

#### Added
- **Embedded images render inline** — Thought entries in the Daily Workspace now render `![[filename.png]]` as `<img>` elements using `app.vault.getResourcePath()`. Supports PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP, AVIF. Non-image embeds render as styled `[[link]]` text. Files not yet indexed fall back to an italic `[image: name]` placeholder. CSS: `.mina-dw-entry-img` (max-height 320px, rounded), `.mina-dw-entry-wikilink`, `.mina-dw-entry-img-placeholder`.

#### Fixed
- **Paste no longer wipes the capture textarea** — `vault.on('create')` was unconditionally calling `notifyRefresh()` for every file created, including attachment binaries saved by the paste handler. This triggered a full tab re-render that cleared the textarea mid-edit. `notifyRefresh()` in the `create` handler is now gated: only fires when the created file is an indexed type (thought / task / habit).
- **Plain Enter is now a line break** — Capture bar previously saved on plain `Enter`, making it impossible to paste or type multi-line content without accidentally saving. Changed to `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` to capture (consistent with EditEntryModal). Header hint updated to `⌘↵ to capture`.
- **`Notice` static import in paste handler** — `await import('obsidian')` is a dynamic import; esbuild treats `obsidian` as external so it resolves to an empty shim at runtime, silently breaking the handler. Fixed by moving `Notice` to the static top-level import in `utils.ts`. Pre-scan of clipboard items is now done synchronously before any `await` so `e.preventDefault()` fires before the browser consumes the event.


### Feature — Clipboard paste & drag-drop attachments in all capture inputs

#### Added
- **Paste images/files from clipboard** — In the Daily Workspace capture bar and the Edit Entry modal (both desktop and mobile), pasting an image (`Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V`) now saves the file to the vault and inserts an Obsidian `![[filename]]` wiki-link at cursor. Works for PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, PDF, and any binary file type.
- **Drag-and-drop files** — Dragging a file from the filesystem directly onto any of the above textareas triggers the same flow: save to vault → insert link.
- **`attachmentsFolder` setting** — New setting (default: `000 Bin/MINA V2 Attachments`) controls where pasted/dropped files are saved. Exposed in the MINA Settings tab under "Storage & Capture".
- **`attachMediaPasteHandler` utility** — Reusable `utils.ts` function that can be wired to any textarea for consistent attachment handling across the plugin.


### Patch — Task/thought folder collision fix & checkbox immediate feedback

#### Fixed
- **Quick-add task no longer creates a phantom thought** — Root cause: `isThoughtFile()` used a bare `path.startsWith(folder)` check. Since `thoughtsFolder` (`'000 Bin/MINA V2'`) is a string prefix of `tasksFolder` (`'000 Bin/MINA V2 Tasks'`), every task file path returned `true` for `isThoughtFile`. The vault `create` event therefore called `indexThoughtFile` for new task files, adding them to `thoughtIndex` and making them appear in the left writing panel. Fixed by appending a trailing `/` to the folder prefix in both `isThoughtFile` and `isTaskFile`.
- **Checkbox completes task immediately** — `toggleTask` writes the file but `metadataCache` updates asynchronously. The previous 200ms `setTimeout` re-render saw stale index data and re-rendered the task as still open. Fixed by directly mutating the `taskIndex` entry's `status` and `modified` fields right after `toggleTask` resolves, followed by `rebuildCalculatedState()` and a synchronous re-render. Same fix applied to the mobile peek-bar checkbox.


### Patch — Daily Workspace quick-add reliability & panel separation

#### Fixed
- **Quick-add task list updates immediately** — root cause was `indexTaskFile()` relying on `metadataCache.getFileCache()` which returns `null` right after file creation. Fixed by directly injecting a `TaskEntry` into `taskIndex` with the known data (title, body, day, status) immediately after `createTaskFile()` resolves, bypassing the async metadataCache pipeline entirely. `rebuildCalculatedState()` is called to keep radar queue consistent. The metadataCache event still runs later and overwrites with the full parsed entry as expected.
- **Left panel shows only thoughts** — the writing surface (left pane) was incorrectly showing both thoughts and tasks, creating confusing duplicate visibility (tasks appeared in left entry list AND right task panel). Left panel now shows today's thoughts only. Tasks created via quick-add or the main capture bar remain exclusively in the right task panel where they belong.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-20
### Patch — Daily Workspace quick-add refresh & delete entries

#### Fixed
- **Quick-add task auto-refresh** — adding a task via the Quick Add input now clears the field immediately, disables it while saving, and re-renders the task list after 500ms (up from 200ms) to give IndexService time to pick up the new file. The task reliably appears in the sidebar after Enter.
- **Delete entries from workspace** — a 🗑 delete button now appears on hover alongside the edit pencil for every thought and task entry. Tapping it opens a confirmation prompt; on confirm the file is moved to trash and the entry list re-renders in place. No tab navigation required.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-20
### Patch — Daily Workspace inline edit

#### Fixed
- **Inline note editing in Daily Workspace** — clicking the ✏️ edit button on any entry now opens `EditEntryModal` directly within the workspace instead of navigating away to the Thoughts or Tasks review tab. Both thought and task entries are handled — the modal pre-fills text, contexts, and due date, saves back via `editThought()`/`editTask()`, and re-renders the workspace in place. Zero context-switching, no lost flow.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-20
### 🚀 Minor Release — Daily Workspace Tab

#### New Features
- **Daily Workspace tab** — freeform daily capture space accessible from Command Center nav and command palette (`Open MINA Daily Workspace`)
- **Split-pane layout (desktop)** — writing surface with sticky capture bar on the left, task sidebar (overdue/today/upcoming) on the right via container queries
- **Toggle-pane layout (mobile)** — WRITE | TASKS segmented toggle with persistent task peek bar at bottom
- **Capture bar** — auto-expanding textarea for quick thought/task capture with Thought/Task mode toggle, inline triggers (@date, [[link, #tag)
- **Chronological entry list** — daily thoughts and tasks rendered with timestamps, tags, and hover action buttons
- **Task sidebar** — open tasks grouped by overdue, today, and upcoming sections with inline checkbox completion
- **Task peek bar (mobile)** — always-visible bottom bar showing next actionable task with one-tap completion
- **Date navigation** — arrow-based day navigation with Today shortcut button
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Ctrl+N (new capture), Ctrl+T (toggle panels), Escape (cancel)
- **Storage** — reuses existing MINA V2 folder via VaultService (no new directories)

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-20
### Patch - Command Center capture input auto-grows with note length

#### Changed
- **Command Center capture textarea** - the inline input now auto-resizes as you type so longer notes expand the input area instead of staying fixed-height
- **Desktop and mobile capture flows** - both Command Center capture paths now share the same autosize behavior on open, input, trigger-driven text changes, and reset
- **Capture shell height caps** - expanded desktop and mobile capture bodies now allow taller note input before clipping

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-20
### Patch - EditEntryModal aligned with Command Center capture bar

#### Changed
- **EditEntryModal desktop layout** - rewrote the desktop path to use semantic CSS classes instead of inline styles so it matches the Command Center capture surface
- **Edit modal textareas** - both mobile and desktop paths now use Calibri to align with the capture bar input styling
- **Mode toggle active state** - mobile float and desktop modal toggles now use the accent-filled active treatment
- **Mobile action row** - Cancel and Capture now share the same pill shape and equal sizing
- **Desktop modal workflow** - added the Thought/Task segmented toggle to desktop and switched due-date controls to the shared `_buildDateStrip()` flow
- **Desktop save behavior** - save button disable/enable behavior now mirrors the mobile modal
- **Mobile chip strip** - removed the inline `+` tag picker from the modal and restored the `# to tag` empty hint when no contexts are selected

#### Removed
- **Inline modal tag picker** - deleted the unused `_toggleInlineTagPicker()` mobile helper and the matching `.mina-tag-picker-*` CSS block

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-20
### 🚀 Minor Release — Bill Overview & Capture Bar Overhaul

#### New Features
- **Bill Overview (Finance Tab redesign)** — complete rebuild of the Financial Ledger into a dedicated "Bill Overview" experience:
  - **Summary strip** — 4 live metric chips (Overdue, Due Today, Upcoming, Total/Mo) with danger/accent tinting when counts are non-zero
  - **Smart status cards** — each bill card carries a 4px left stripe and 4% background tint keyed to status: `is-overdue` (red), `is-today` (accent), `is-soon` (amber, ≤7d), `is-upcoming` (neutral), `is-inactive` (desaturated)
  - **Status badges** — inline pill badges per card: `OVERDUE`, `DUE TODAY`, `In Xd / Tomorrow`, `↻ Recurring`, `PAID`
  - **Active/All History toggle** — full-width segmented pill on mobile, compact fit-content on desktop via container query
  - **FAB (mobile) / inline "+ New Bill" (desktop)** — CSS-only visibility swap using Obsidian's `.is-mobile` / `.is-desktop` body classes; FAB respects `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for iOS home indicator
  - **Tap-to-open** — card body opens the vault note directly (`Platform.isMobile ? 'tab' : 'window'`); pay button isolated with `e.stopPropagation()` and a 60×60px invisible tap zone via `::before`
  - **Empty state** — copy adapts to Active vs All History filter mode; CTA opens `NewDueModal`
  - **CSS container queries** (`@container mina-bills`) — layout responds to Obsidian panel width, not viewport — 2→4 column summary, full→fit-content toggle, 2→1 line bill name clamp
  - **RGB fallback tokens** — `--mina-bills-error-rgb` and `--mina-bills-warning-rgb` added to `:root`; Obsidian themes are not guaranteed to expose `--text-error-rgb` / `--text-warning-rgb`
  - **Mobile-first touch UX** — 44px minimum tap targets throughout; CSS-only ripple on `:active::after`; `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent`; `scale(0.91)` press feedback on pay button; no `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` hover-only states

- **`#` tag trigger in capture bar** — typing `#` in the capture textarea opens a native `SuggestModal` (`ContextSuggestModal`) pre-filtered by typed text, identical UX to Obsidian's `[[` link trigger. `+ Create "#tag"` option available for new tags. Replaces the broken inline DOM-based pill panel.

- **Timeline infinite scroll** — feed loads stacked day sections; `IntersectionObserver` sentinels auto-load ±2 days on scroll; spotlight carousel syncs to currently visible day; prepend preserves scroll position.

- **Timeline perspective carousel** — 5-item header carousel with scale/opacity depth; center item 72px accent; swipe/drag navigation with velocity-based day jumping (Pointer Events API, `touch-action: pan-y`).

#### Fixed
- **Desktop: letter 'C' blocked in capture textarea** — `onKey` shortcut guard now checks `cap.hasClass('is-expanded')` first; when bar is open no shortcut ever fires
- **Capture re-render suppression** — `_capturePending` flag prevents `notifyRefresh()` from wiping the DOM during active capture
- **Tag autocomplete null crash** — `null` entries in `settings.contexts` no longer crash `getSuggestions()`
- **Timeline — frozen carousel header** — `mina-tl-wrap` uses `position: absolute; inset: 0` + `min-height: 0` on feed flex child
- **Timeline — deleted entry re-appears** — trash-renamed files excluded from `isThoughtFile()` / `isTaskFile()` path guards

#### Changed
- Capture textarea font → Calibri; padding reduced; `min-height` 72px
- Cancel + Capture buttons → equal `flex: 1` size; accent color on active mode toggle
- `# to tag` static hint removed from chip strip


### Added
- **Bill Overview — `is-soon` card status** — Bills due within 7 days now receive the `is-soon` CSS class (previously all future bills got `is-upcoming`). Cards with this status show a warning-amber left stripe and a 4% amber background tint for clear visual urgency differentiation.
- **Bill Overview — card background tints** — Status-aware subtle background washes added: overdue → 4% red, due today → 4% accent, due soon (≤7d) → 4% amber. Inactive/upcoming cards retain neutral background.
- **Bill Overview — RGB fallback tokens** — Added `--mina-bills-error-rgb: 239, 68, 68` and `--mina-bills-warning-rgb: 245, 158, 11` to `:root`. These ensure `rgba()` tints and stripe colors work correctly across all Obsidian themes regardless of whether `--text-error-rgb` / `--text-warning-rgb` are defined by the theme.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-04-20
### Fixed
- **Desktop: letter 'C' blocked in capture textarea** — `onKey` document-level shortcut listener was intercepting every `C` keypress using `document.activeElement` (global scope), which could diverge from `parent.ownerDocument.activeElement` inside Obsidian's rendering context. Fixed by adding `if (cap.hasClass('is-expanded')) return` as the first guard — when the capture bar is already open, the shortcut never fires regardless of focus state.

### Changed
- **Capture input — reduced padding** — `.mina-capture-inline-canvas` padding reduced from `14px 16px` to `8px 12px`; textarea `min-height` reduced from 96px to 72px; textarea `padding-top` set to `0` for a tighter, denser input area
- **Capture toggle — accent color on both desktop & mobile** — `.mina-capture-inline-toggle .mina-seg-btn.is-active` uses `var(--interactive-accent)` background. Desktop `toggleBar` now also carries the `mina-capture-inline-toggle` class so the accent rule applies consistently across both layouts
- **Cancel / Capture buttons — equal size** — both buttons now use `flex: 1` (previously `flex: 1` / `flex: 2`), rendering as identical-width pills in the action row
- **Removed `# to tag` hint** — chip strip no longer shows the static hint text when no tags are selected; strip is simply empty until a tag is added via `#` trigger

## [1.0.12] - 2026-04-20
### Changed
- **Capture textarea — Calibri font** — `font-family` on `.mina-capture-inline-textarea` changed from `var(--font-text)` to `'Calibri', var(--font-text), sans-serif` for both desktop and mobile capture bars
- **Capture textarea — removed top padding** — `padding: 12px 0 0 0` reduced to `padding: 0`; text now starts flush at the top of the input area
- **Mobile capture — CANCEL pill matches CAPTURE shape** — `.mina-capture-inline-cancel` redesigned as a ghost pill: `border-radius: 10px`, `border: 1.5px solid var(--background-modifier-border-faint)`, `min-height: 44px`, uppercase 800-weight label — visually identical shape to the CAPTURE button. Both buttons use `flex: 1` / `flex: 2` ratio so CAPTURE stays dominant. Active state transitions border and text color instead of the old plain text fade.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-04-20
### Fixed
- **`#` tag trigger — replaced broken inline suggest panel with native `SuggestModal`** — the inline DOM-based pill panel was unreliable due to overflow clipping, focus loss, and re-render collisions. Replaced entirely with `ContextSuggestModal` (Obsidian `SuggestModal`) opened immediately when `#` is typed at the start of text or after whitespace — identical UX to `[[`. The `#` is stripped from the textarea, the modal opens pre-filtered, and selecting a tag fires `onContext(tag)` to add a chip. `+ Create "#tag"` option shown when the typed name is new.
- **Tag autocomplete — null crash** — a `null` entry in `settings.contexts` (from malformed YAML `context:` frontmatter) caused `ctx.toLowerCase()` to throw inside `getSuggestions()`, silently returning zero results. Fix: `loadSettings()` now strips null/non-string entries on startup; `scanForContexts()` guards nulls on accumulation; `ContextSuggestModal.getSuggestions()` filters defensively before any string ops.
- **Capture bar re-render suppression** — `saveSettings()` was being called inside the `onContext` callback during live capture (writing `data.json` → vault `modify` event → `notifyRefresh()` → 400 ms debounce → full `renderView()` → DOM wipe). Fix: `onContext` only mutates `plugin.settings.contexts` in memory; `saveSettings()` is deferred to `handleSave` (after capture success). Added `_capturePending` flag to `MinaView` (mirrors existing `_taskTogglePending` pattern); set to `1` on capture bar expand and `0` on collapse; `notifyRefresh()` skips `renderView()` while `_capturePending > 0`.
- **`attachInlineTriggers` shared utility** — added optional `getContexts?: () => string[]` 5th parameter; both `CommandCenterTab` and `EditEntryModal` now pass `() => plugin.settings.contexts ?? []` so `ContextSuggestModal` receives the live list at modal-open time.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-04-21
### Fixed
- **Desktop capture bar — inline triggers** (`@date`, `[[`, `+`) now work correctly in the inline expand bar. Logic extracted from `EditEntryModal._attachInlineTriggers` into shared `attachInlineTriggers(app, textarea, setDueDate)` utility in `utils.ts`. Wired to the desktop expand textarea in `CommandCenterTab`. `@date` trigger also auto-switches capture mode to Task.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Timeline — spotlight carousel header** — replaced the flat horizontal date strip with a 5-item perspective carousel merged into the header; the center (spotlight) item is large (72 px) with accent background and drop shadow; ±1 items are scaled to 0.9 at 70% opacity; ±2 items are scaled to 0.76 at 38% opacity; a full-date subtitle (`MONDAY, APRIL 21 · 2026`) sits below the carousel
- **Timeline — swipe/drag navigation** — added horizontal swipe on the carousel track using the Pointer Events API (unified mouse-drag + touch-swipe handler); velocity-based day jumping: slow (<0.45 px/ms) = 1 day, medium = 2–3 days, fast (>1.5 px/ms) = 4 days; 25 px minimum threshold prevents micro-movement triggers; `setPointerCapture` keeps tracking if pointer leaves the element; `touch-action: pan-y` preserves native vertical scroll on mobile
- **Timeline — infinite vertical scroll** — feed now loads multiple day sections stacked vertically with sticky day headers; `IntersectionObserver` sentinels at top/bottom boundaries auto-load 2 more days as user scrolls; a second `IntersectionObserver` on each day header syncs the spotlight carousel to the currently visible day; prepend operations preserve scroll position via `scrollTop` + `scrollHeight` delta; `navigateToDate()` performs partial updates (header-only re-render + smooth scroll to target day) without destroying the feed

### Fixed
- **Timeline — carousel scrolls out of view** — `.mina-tl-wrap` switched from `height: 100%` to `position: absolute; inset: 0; overflow: hidden` so it reliably fills Obsidian's view container; `.mina-tl-feed` gained `min-height: 0` (critical flexbox fix — without it a flex child won't constrain its height and the whole page scrolls instead of just the feed); the header slot now stays frozen at the top at all times

## [1.0.8] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Timeline — deleted entry re-appears after deletion** — `VaultService.deleteFile()` renames to a `/trash/` subfolder rather than hard-deleting, which fires a vault `'rename'` event. Because `/trash/` lives inside the thoughts/tasks folder, `isThoughtFile()` / `isTaskFile()` returned `true` for the trash path, causing the renamed file to be immediately re-indexed and re-appear in the timeline. Fix: exclude paths containing `/trash/` in `isThoughtFile()` and `isTaskFile()` in `IndexService`.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Timeline — delete not reflected in view** — after confirming a delete, the entry was still visible because `renderTimeline()` ran before the async vault `'delete'` event could update the index. Fix: eagerly remove the entry from `thoughtIndex` / `taskIndex` before calling `renderTimeline()`, matching the same eager-purge pattern used in `main.ts`'s vault event handler

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Timeline — full redesign** — complete architectural and visual overhaul of the Timeline tab:
  - **Header bar**: Home icon + "TIMELINE" label + "+ NEW" accent FAB button for quick capture
  - **Date carousel**: horizontal scroll with 75-day range (60 back, 14 forward); activity dots on dates with entries; TODAY pill with accent ring; active pill with accent fill; auto-scrolls to selected date on render
  - **Entry feed**: vertical spine layout — left accent line with node dots per entry; cards distinguish THOUGHT (accent) vs TASK (amber) via colored left-border and type badge
  - **Entry cards**: meta row (type badge + timestamp), body text rendered as Markdown, footer with due-date chip + context pills, hover-reveal Edit + Delete action buttons
  - **Empty state**: centered glyph + message + ghost "Capture a thought" CTA
  - **New entry capture**: "+ NEW" FAB and empty-state CTA both open the standard `EditEntryModal`
  - All inline styles replaced with semantic CSS classes (`.mina-tl-*`); 323 lines of new CSS added to `styles.css`

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Navigation — new window renders correct tab** — `MinaView` now overrides `getState()` and `setState()` so Obsidian correctly applies `activeTab` and `isDedicated` when a new window leaf is created via `setViewState()`; previously the new window always rendered the Command Center (home) regardless of which button was clicked

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Navigation — new-window mode** — clicking any ACTION, MANAGEMENT, or SYSTEM button in the Command Center footer now opens the target mode in a **new window** (desktop) or new tab (mobile) instead of replacing the current view
- **activateView — exact tab match** — the leaf-reuse logic now matches by `activeTab` for all leaves (dedicated and non-dedicated), so clicking the same nav button a second time focuses the existing window rather than spawning a duplicate

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Command Center — Intelligence hidden** — hid the Intelligence section from the Command Center UI for now without removing the underlying AI implementation
- **Command Center — center strip removed** — removed the remaining section between the Weekly/Monthly goals block and the footer button clusters so the layout flows directly into navigation

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Tasks — merged open queue** — merged the separate Inbox and Due filters into one `Open` view that groups tasks by Overdue, Today, Upcoming, and No Date while preserving `No Date` as a focused subset filter

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Checklist — Refresh button** — ↻ icon in CHECKLIST header re-indexes `thoughtChecklistIndex` from vault and re-renders the view on demand
- **IndexService — `thoughtDoneChecklistIndex`** — new index populated with `- [x]` lines from MINA V2 files modified today; cleared on each `buildThoughtIndex` rebuild

### Changed
- **Checklist — section order** — CHECKLIST now renders above the Overdue task group in the Command Center TO DO area
- **Checklist — tick behaviour** — ticking an item instantly moves it to the bottom of the list via local re-render (no full view re-render); item is sourced from vault truth (`thoughtDoneChecklistIndex`) after re-index, with `checklistCompletedToday` as the optimistic 400 ms window
- **Checklist — drag reorder** — all items (open and done) are now draggable; `checklistOrder` tracks the full combined list; deduplication prevents double entries after vault re-index
- **Checklist — done items source** — done items shown in CHECKLIST are now read directly from the vault (`- [x]` in today's files) rather than session state alone
- **CommandCenterTab — inline triggers** — `@word ` resolves to `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]` via NLP date parsing; `+` at line start inserts `- [ ] `; `[[` opens file suggester
- **IndexService — YAML field fixes** — `context:` (singular) read correctly; `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]` wikilink strings stripped before date comparison
- **Commands** — removed all plugin commands except "MINA: Open Command Center"
- **Navigation** — removed all plugin ribbon icons except the Command Center entry

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Command Center** — primary hub with Tactical Core, Zen Mode focus toggle, and reactive nerve system
- **Thought Capture** — instant modal with YAML-based metadata, context tagging, and auto-linking
- **Task Ledger** — YAML-native task files with status, due date, and project fields
- **AI Chat (AiTab)** — grounded chat against vault thoughts via Gemini API with citation support
- **Voice Memos (VoiceTab)** — in-browser MediaRecorder with transcription via Gemini
- **Financial Ledger (DuesTab)** — obligation tracking with payment recording and next-due management
- **Habits System** — daily habit files with streak tracking
- **Synthesis Mode (SynthesisTab)** — zero-inbox triage for unprocessed thoughts
- **Weekly Review / Quarterly Compass** — GTD-style review cadence with North Star goals
- **Projects** — tag-based project grouping across thoughts and tasks
- **Daily View** — aggregated daily dashboard across tasks, dues, thoughts, and habits
- **IndexService** — O(1) in-memory indices for all entity types with reactive file-watcher updates
- **VaultService** — unified file I/O with YAML injection-safe frontmatter builders
- **AiService** — Gemini integration with chunked base64, injection boundary markers, model allowlist, and API key header security
- **17 tabs, 17 modals** — full Personal OS feature set
